# New-IceandFire
A Song of Ice and Fire Database http://localhost:3000/
It collects all of the Characters and Houses from the book "A Song of Ice and Fire" and displays them
It displays 10 characters/houses per page and when you press the next button it displays the next 10 characters/houses. After pressing the next page the page number changes and you go also go back to the previous page.
The Home page can take you to either the Character or House page and you can also return back to the home page from the either the House/Character page
I have a test to catch an error while collecting the house/character response data from the API. These tests can be found on the Characters and Houses pages.
The standard flow is we start at the Home Page where we can see images of Character and Houses pages. When clicking on these it sends you to their respective pages. You can also go to the pages from the NavBar.
I used React JS to create the webpage
